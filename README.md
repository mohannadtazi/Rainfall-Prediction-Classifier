# Rainfall-Prediction-Classifier

### Overview
This project aims to predict whether it will rain the following day using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used is sourced from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. The project demonstrates the application of several classification algorithms, including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

### Objectives
- To preprocess and clean the rainfall dataset.
- To implement and compare multiple classification algorithms.
- To evaluate model performance using various metrics.
### Algorithms Used
- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
### Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy Score
- Jaccard Index
- F1-Score
- Log Loss
- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- RÂ² Score
### Requirements
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
### Usage
To run the notebook:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells to see the predictions and model evaluations.
